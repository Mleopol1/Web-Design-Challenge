# Web Design Challenge

## Project Explanation

This project is designed to visualize weather data for various cities around the world. The weather data is displayed in several visualizations and presented on a website using Bootstrap for styling.

## Website Pages
### Landing Page

The landing page contains an overview of the project and links to the four visualization pages.

### Visualization Pages

There are four visualization pages that each display a different weather metric:

   * Max Temperature
   * Humidity
   * Cloudiness
   * Wind Speed

Each visualization page has a title, the visualization image, and a paragraph describing the significance of the visualization.

### Comparisons Page

The comparisons page displays all four visualizations on a single page, allowing users to easily compare them. The visualizations are arranged in a grid format, with two visualizations displayed side-by-side on medium and large screens, and one visualization displayed on small screens.

### Data Page

The data page displays a responsive table containing the weather data used to create the visualizations. The table is created using the Bootstrap table component and displays the data in a user-friendly format.

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is displayed at the top of every page and contains the following links:

   * Home: Returns the user to the landing page.
   * Plots: A dropdown menu containing links to each of the visualization pages.
   * Compare: Links to the comparisons page.
   * Data: Links to the data page.

The navigation bar is responsive and uses Bootstrap for styling.
